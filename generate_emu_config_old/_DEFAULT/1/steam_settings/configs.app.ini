[app::paths]
# some rare games might need to be provided one or more paths to appids, e.g. the path to where a DLC is installed
# however some other games might expect this function to return an empty path to properly load a DLC
# this sets the paths returned by the `Steam_Apps::GetAppInstallDir()` function - relative or empty after the '='
